- 👋 Hi, I’m @elnigerian
- 👀 I’m interested in building next generation systems that uplift and empower others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go and rediscovering my Java roots after deepening my expertise in the NodeJS world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opportunities that lend themselves to creating infrastructure, tools or services that empower. Note that, the challenge, imho, is worth more than the immediate financial benefit.
- 📫 How to reach me ... if you are on here, then that's a start. It also means you can and will reach me.
